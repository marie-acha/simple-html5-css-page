                    <p>White Beach is Boracay's main tourist attraction and understandably the most jam-packed area since the most popular activity in the island is the Boracay sightseeing beach trip. 
                        Aside from the undeniable charm of the beautiful white sand and sparkling azure waters, everything you need is a stone's throw away from White Beach.

                        You'll also know why the island is on the top of the must-visit places in the world.

                        The excellent way to bond with your friends and family is to try some of these highly recommended water activities.
                        Some of the best activities are Banana Boat Ride, Paraw Sailing, Fly Fish, and Jet Ski.

                    <li>Explore the Underwaters</li>
                    <img src="images/underwater-boracay.jpg" alt="underwater-boracay" width="800px" height="400px">
                    <p>One of the highly recommended activities in Boracay is to go underwater and get an in-depth look at the plentiful corals.
                        As someone who is afraid to go to open water, I wasn't able to enjoy this but it doesn't stop me from recommending it.
                        Snorkeling is the way to go! You can also do Scuba Diving, but requires training on how to breathe correctly underwater.
